Description: The transport package in R specializes in solving optimal transport problems,
      enabling the computation of Wasserstein distances, also known as Kantorovich, Fortet–Mourier,
      Mallows, Earth Mover’s, or minimal Lp distances. This package provides functionality to not
      only calculate Wasserstein distances but also return the associated transport plans.
      Moreover, it offers graphical tools for visualizing these transport plans.The `transport` 
      package is versatile in its application, as it allows users to compare
      a variety of objects, including grey-scale images, weighted point patterns, and mass
      vectors. This makes it a powerful tool for analyzing and quantifying the dissimilarity
      between distributions, with broad applications in image analysis, spatial statistics, 
      and other fields where optimal transport distances provide valuable insights into the 
      structural relationships between datasets.
